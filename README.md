## WHAT IS TALUS
**Talus** is a wordlist generator that allows the user to create his own wordlists, based on
asked data to him. Once the info is provided, this tool creates a file that contains
six permutations of this data, changing the order of the info. introduced (this will change in the future
to make the wordlist more sofisticated).

    <b>Why Talus?</b>
    <br>
    It's related to the Talus monster that appears in both TLOZ: BOTW and TOTK. Due to wordlists being used most for brute force access, I thought Talus
  is a funny representation of both brute and force applied in this type of attack.
